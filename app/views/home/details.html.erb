				<strong>What is the goal</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal of this app is to pull data from various sources to automate the creation of the 
				scorecard for the Premium organization.  The automation can take various forms:
			</p>
			<ul class="section-data">
				<li> - Pull data 'realtime' from various sources upon page load (likely slow)</li>
				<li> - Run background scheduled jobs to pull data and store in database, then page load calls from db</li>
				<li> - Cache data, but in background - when job runs - refresh cache</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The app should be built in a simple manner, such that new data is easy to add.  Eventually, create the 
				page sections as widgets, likely using React.  Also, the data should drill down... clicking on the 
				site performance chart (for instance) would take you to a performance page, with detailed performance 
				statistics, that also would link to CSM, iGraph, etc.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Other sections should do likewise (taking you to team specific TT pages, or the oncall schedule, JIRA, etc.)
